High level overview of various programming languages and what they do.

Essential Terminology

------

**Learning Objective**: Learn the essential words and concepts that are used on a daily basis by engineers and project/product managers on the job.

------

Here are some words and concepts that will hopefully give you a more holistic view of the more technical aspects of the industry.

#### Define: Program

------

Discrete, highly logical and explicit instructions that are parsed and executed by a computer.

We call this set of human-readable instructions **source code**, or colloquially, a **computer program**.

**Compilers** can take this source code and transform it into **machine code**, a representation of the source that can be executed by the computer's **central processing unit** or **CPU**.

Not all programs are compiled though, some are **interpreted**. The difference is that compiled languages need a step where the source code is physically transformed into machine code. However, with an interpreted language, this additional step is **excluded** in favor of **parsing** and **executing** the source code directly when the program is run.

Speaking of source code, sometimes programmers, even ones acting on behalf of corporate giants like Apple, publish the source code for their programs. This is called **open source**. 

#### How programs are written

------

All programs are composed with a collection of **fundamental** concepts that, when combined, can essentially dictate a wide variety of tasks a computer can perform.

Here are a collection of these most important concepts:

- **Declarations**: typically, we can store and retrieve data in our programs by associating them with intermediary values that we call **variables**
- **Expressions**: we use expressions to evaluate stuff. For example, **2 + 2** is an example of an expression that will **evaluate** a value, namely 4.
- **NOTE**: typically we can use expressions and declarations in tandem to perform complex tasks. For instance, we can reference a variable we declared in an expression to help us evaluate new values which can then be stored.
- **Statements**: statements will use expressions and declarations to alternate a program's **control flow**, which is essentially the order in which declarations, expressions, and other statements are executed.

Aside from these fundamental concepts, we also talk a lot about this idea of **algorithms**. An **algorithm** is simple a series of declarations, expressions, and statements that can be used over and over again to solve well defined problems of a certain type.

People tend to talk about algorithms like they are mysterious forces of nature, but I guarantee that you know a few algorithms yourself.

For example, we can implement an algorithm that converts temperature from **fahrenheit** to **celsius**. It would look something like this:

1. **Declare** F = 32;
2. **Expression** ( **F** - 32 ) / 1.8;
3. **Declare** C = **Evaluated** expression from **[2]**

This is a form of **pseudo** code where we define the steps a computer program — **any** — computer program can take to convert **fahrenheit** to **celsius**.

The beauty of programming is that all of it revolves around the same key set of concepts and ideas. For this reason, we do not need to specify any **particular programming language ** when discussing the functional aspects of a program.

#### Define: Programming languages

------

A programming language is a series of **grammar** and **rules** that we can define towards writing source code.

Languages are effectively different approaches towards communicating the same ideas in programming. Essentially, we can communicate in say both **French** and **English**, what mainly differs is the structure of our sentences and the actual words and sounds themselves.

The **same analogy** can be made with programming languages.

#### Examples of programming languages

------

There are many. Way too many.

Here are some of the most popular ones, though.

1. **JavaScript**: this language is interpreted.
2. **Python**: this language is interpreted.
3. **Java**: this language is compiled
4. **Ruby**: this language is interpreted.
5. **C/C++**: this language is compiled.

These languages all build on the same concepts defined above; the main difference lies in **how** they are run (compiled vs interpreted) and also **how** they are used.

In general, anything programmable can be programmed in each of the languages defined above. However, some languages are better suited for certain tasks above others.

For example, to perform web programming on the front-end, you'll want to write JavaScript. This is because all browsers collectively support running javascript within it's environment

# What is web development?

------

The use of programming languages and concepts towards producing a system that listens to user requests over the internet and serves back HTML, CSS, and interaction code to the client.

#### What is the difference between a web site and web app

------

Web sites are more **static**. Think of them as sort of like interactive brochures. They typically don't hold any state and are usually just information.

A web app is more like an iOS or Android app. It holds state, does not refresh itself and in general **does something** vs **showing something**.

#### What are the stages of web development

------

Depends on the methodology used by team. Typically, there is a UX phase, a Design phase, a Development phase bundled with extensive QA. This was the process used in the large company I used to work in.

For a startup, the process is similar, however there is a lot more room for iteration and testing out ideas by putting something up for users to use and deliver feedback.

#### What is the difference between front-end and back-end web development

------

**Front end**: Client side interactions and structure. This includes stuff like iOS apps and whatever you load in browser.

**Back end**: Server side, data storage and retrival. Needs a client **of some sort** (not necessarily a browser) to work. Deals with storing and retriving information.

#### Main Class Deliverable

------

In order to explore the core concepts of this class and achieve our learning objectives, we will recreate the **traditional resume template** for the web.

#### Key Requirements

------

- Template should resemble the typical resume.pdf we all maintain
- Template should use tasteful CSS3 styles to accentuate key peices of information and design principles
- Template should work across all screens including (and specifically) mobile
- Template should be **printer friendly** and take up exactly one page when printed.



# HTML lesson

Show them pop code and script ed sheet.

## Front end code is totally on your own machine



Show them dev tools



look at dev tools in facebook

show them the You Tube trick



```javascript
$('video').currentTime = $('video').duration
```



Go and change some stuff in the browser's rendered HTML.

## You do

- Go to a news website and have some fun. 
- Make your uncle the king of Thailand. Change the election results. Add some digits to your bank account.
- Refresh the page and see your dreams melt away.



This is what I mean by front end or client side. 







# We Do: HTML Elements



Create a folder on your desktop called `resume_html`

Drag it onto Atom in the dock or taskbar in windows.

Create a new file in there called `resume.html`

Before your browser even knows that it's supposed to roll with HTML, you have to tell it. 

```html
<!doctype html>
<!-- this is a comment that will show up in source code--> 

<!-- Most users won't see this --> 

<html>
 <head>
 <!--
 the HEAD section of html does not have any content
 that the user can see

 instead, we place things like:
 page title
 external css links
 SEO keywords
 here
 -->
 <meta charset="utf-8">
 <title>My resume</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 <!--

 the BODY section will contain all the tags
 that the user can _SEE_ and _INTERACT_ with
 -->
 </body>
</html>
```

HTML is made of *elements*.

Each little thing is an element.

They can nest to kingdom come if you like





<!doctype html> 

This tag tells the browser to read our HTML content as HTML5, the latest and greatest revision of the HTML spec. We MUST include it as the first thing on our .html files. I usually type it as all lower case, but it's common practice to also type as: <!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

This is the root tag. Basically, all other tags in your html file must live inside this tag. Note how on the bottom of the code snippet, we have a </html> This is called closing a tag and we must close all tags that we open (with the exception of a few). If we do not do this, our HTML markup becomes invalid.

<head>

This section contains content that does not show the user things. Typically, we would expect to see things such as the page title, external links, and SEO tags here.

<body>

All the magic happens here. All the tags the user sees and interacts with should live in this tag.



Comments and why they are so handy for programmers



```html
<!--
 the h1 - or heading one - will have the most important text on page 
 by the old guard, we should really only have one h1 per page
 -->
 <h1>Hello, Wrold</h1>

 <h2>This is a h2</h2>

 <h3>This is an h3</h3>

 <h4>This is an h4</h4>

 <h5>This is an h5</h5>

 <h6>This is an h6</h6> 

 <!--
 this is an inline element
 unline the block element, which is meant to provide structure
 the inline element is interpreted as content
 this means that will appear next to one another
 -->
 <strong>This is an inline element</strong>
 <strong>This is another inline element</strong>

 <!-- this is a block element so it will NOT be on the same line -->
 <h1>Will this be on the same line?</h1>

 <!-- 

 differences between block elements and inline elements
 block: takes up entire width of page unless otherwise told 
 (we don't know how yet)
 we can impose dimensions on block elements
 inline: meant to be content or text
 we cannot impose dimensions on inline elements 

 -->

 <!-- how to add more spaces or line breaks?? -->
 <h1>THIS will have many &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spaces</h1>

 <h1>This is <br> Sparta</h1>

 <a href="http://www.google.com">Hello, Wrold I'm a link, yo</a>

 <!--
 this is one mode
 <tagName attribute1="someValue" attribute2="someOtherValue"></tagName>

 this is a self closing tag
 <tagName attribute1="someValue" attribute2="someOtherValue">
 --> 

 <!--
 convention: 
 external links open up in new tab
 absolute URLs

 internal links open up in same tab
 relative URLs
 -->

 <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Hello, Wrold I'm ALSO a link, yo</a>

Assignment lab:

You now have everything you need to make a resume in HTML.

It's going to be all Times New Roman and stuff but it's important to get the practice into your very fingers.

Use your actual resume or generate nonsense text at Hipster Ipsum

https://hipsum.co/

After you are in good shape, we'll use some CSS to give these Crappy Times New Roman things style.



# CSS!



CSS is code that tells the browser how to make things look. It's hella fast and powerful.
