# Intro to flexbox!

#### What is flexbox?

Flexbox is short for "The CSS3 Flexible Box Module". From [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes), here's a definiton:

> Flexbox ... is a layout mode providing for the arrangement of elements on a page such that the elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices. ... The defining aspect of the flex layout is the ability to alter its items' width and/or height to best fit in the available space on any display device.

### Flex context vs block context

- Up to this point we've been working with the block context -- `display: block;`. This means that in order to position things, we needed to float them, use clearfix, etc.
- Flexbox introduces a new context: `display: flex;`.
- Elements with `display: flex;` have, largely, an external block context -- they exist in the document flow like any other kind of element.
- Internally, they create a new type of context that has its own properties.

## Flex containers and flex items

### A flex _container_ is an element that creates a flex context.

From the [W3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-containers): 

> A flex container establishes a new flex formatting context for its contents. This is the same as establishing a block formatting context, except that flex layout is used instead of block layout. For example, floats do not intrude into the flex container ... Flex containers form a containing block for their contents exactly like block containers do.

The flex context works a little differently from the ordinary block context that is the default of the document flow. A number of properties are different or do not apply.

- `float` and `clear` don't have any effect on flex items
- `vertical-align` has no effect on a flex item
- Some pseudoelements, like `::first-line` and `::first-letter`, don't apply to flex containers.

### A flex _item_ is an element that exists within a flex context.

From the [W3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-items): 

> Each in-flow child of a flex container becomes a flex item, and each contiguous run of text that is directly contained inside a flex container is wrapped in an anonymous flex item. 

### Nesting flex contexts within flex contexts (flexception....?? )

#### Follow along in ‚ú® [this new codepen!](https://codepen.io/jlr7245/pen/pPgZwb?editors=1100) ‚ú®

From the [W3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-items): 

> A flex item establishes a new formatting context for its contents. The type of this formatting context is determined by its display value, as usual. However, flex items themselves are flex-level boxes, not block-level boxes: they participate in their container‚Äôs flex formatting context, not in a block formatting context.

## Flex Properties and Axes (axises? axes?)

There's a long list of CSS properties that are specific to either flex containers or flex items. We'll go through a few of them, and then you'll get practice with the rest during lab.

### Main Axis, Cross Axis

A lot of the power in flexbox comes from the ability to switch which axis is which with just one property.

### üìö Flex Container Properties

([Taken largely from CSSTricks complete guide to flexbox.](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/))

<dl>
  <dt><code>display</code></dt>
  <dd>In order to create a flex context, you must declare it using <code>display: flex;</code>. (Note: You may also occasionally see <code>display: inline-flex;</code> but I have not had to use this. If you want to know what it does, I encourage you to mess around.)</dd>
  
  <dt><code>flex-direction</code></dt>
  <dd><code>flex-direction</code> establishes which axis is the main axis and which is the cross axis. The possible values are <code>row</code>, <code>row-reverse</code>, <code>column</code>, and <code>column-reverse</code>. The behavior of other properties are dependent on <code>flex-direction</code>.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>flex-wrap</code></dt>
  <dd>By default, flex items all try to fit into one line. <code>flex-wrap</code> changes this behavior, allowing items to wrap to new lines. The possible values are <code>nowrap</code>, <code>wrap</code>, <code>wrap-reverse</code>.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>flex-flow</code></dt>
  <dd>A shorthand property for <code>flex-direction</code> and <code>flex-wrap</code>. The default value is <code>row nowrap</code>. There's a bunch of different possible values -- essentially, pick one <code>flex-direction</code> value and one <code>flex-wrap</code> value and combine them.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>justify-content</code></dt>
  <dd>Defines the alignment and spacing along the main axis, and helps distribute extra, leftover free space. The possible values are <code>flex-start</code>, <code>flex-end</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>space-between</code>, and <code>space-around</code>. <a href='https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#article-header-id-6' target='_blank'>See CSS Tricks article for reference</a>.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>align-items</code></dt>
  <dd><code>align-items</code> describes how flex items are placed relative to the flex container. The possible values are <code>flex-start</code>, <code>flex-end</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>stretch</code> (the default), and <code>baseline</code>.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>align-content</code></dt>
  <dd>This aligns a flex container's lines when there's extra space on the cross axis. The available values are <code>flex-start</code>, <code>flex-end</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>stretch</code> (the default), <code>space-between</code>, and <code>space-around</code>. <b>NOTE!</b> This property has no effect unless there's more than one line of flex items.  </dd>
</dl>

### üìö Flex Item Properties

([Taken largely from CSSTricks complete guide to flexbox.](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/))

<dl>
  <dt><code>order</code></dt>
  <dd>The order in which you want flex items to appear along the main access. The default is 0. Negative numbers are allowed.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>flex-grow</code></dt>
  <dd>Defines the proportion of the space in the container that the flex item will take up. For ex, if all flex items in a flex container have a <code>flex-grow</code> property of 1, they will all take up equal width. If one of the children has <code>flex-grow: 2;</code>, it will be twice as wide as the others.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>flex-shrink</code></dt>
  <dd>Defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>flex-basis</code></dt>
  <dd>Defines the default size of an element. You can use any CSS unit of measurement -- percent, pixels, em, etc.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>flex</code></dt>
  <dd>This is a shorthand property that combines <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>, and <code>flex-basis</code>. It's recommended to use <code>flex</code> instead of setting the other properties individually. You have to include <code>flex-grow</code>, but the other two parameters are optional. Usually you'll include <code>flex-grow</code> and <code>flex-basis</code>, like this: <code>flex: 1 300px;</code>.</dd>
  
  <dt><code>align-self</code></dt>
  <dd>This allows the default alignment (as set by <code>align-items</code>) to be overridden for individual items.</dd>
</dl>

# Why use flexbox?

As you may have noticed, ***flexbox is literally magic***. Problems that take hours of messing with floats, positions, and so on, are solved in minutes. And responsiveness is a dream -- just change the `flex-direction` between mobile and desktop and you're all set.

There are a number of classic web design problems that once took odd CSS hacks and patches to fix, but are now a breeze with flexbox. Let's walk through one of them together.

### üèÜ The Holy Grail

You've seen the Holy Grail layout about a billion times. It looks like this:

![holy grail](./assets/holy-grail.png)

To put this image into words, the Holy Grail layout:

1. Has a fluid center (i.e. the center column changes width as the browser window changes width) and fixed-width sidebars, all of which are the same height;
2. Allows the center column to appear first in the HTML;
3. Allows any column to have the most content;
4. Has fixed-height header and footer that span the width of the page;
5. Has a footer that reaches at least the bottom of the browser window no matter the height of the content without using absolute or fixed positioning;
6. Requires only one extra element; and
7. Uses as little CSS as possible.

(This is based on the description of the Holy Grail problem from [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/article/holygrail).)

We're going to be working from this HTML:

```html
<body>
  <header>Header</header>
  <main>
    <article>Content</article>
    <aside class='left'>Left sidebar</aside>
    <aside class='right'>Right sidebar</aside>
  </main>
  <footer>Footer</footer>
</body>
```

<details>
<summary>Here's the CSS solution. Don't peek!!! We'll walk through it together. But I wanted you to have it in case you want to come back to it later.</summary>

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

header, footer {
  flex: 0 150px;
}

main {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
}

article {
  order: 2;
  flex: 3;
}

aside {
  flex: 0 300px;
}

.left {
  order: 1;
}

.right {
  order: 3;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 1025px) {
  main {
    flex-direction: column;
  }

  article {
    order: 0;
  }

  aside {
    flex: 0;
  }
}
```
</details>

#### But J! How would you do this without flexbox!

I thought about walking through the flexboxless solution for the Holy Grail layout. But the fix without flexbox is so genuinely awful and contains so many practices that I'd like to avoid that it's really not worth even presenting. 

And there's one element of the problem the way I've presented it -- "5. Has a footer that reaches at least the bottom of the browser window no matter the height of the content without using absolute or fixed positioning" -- that might actually be impossible without flexbox.

If you're interested in the equal-height-columns problem, which is a classic CSS problem that I've had to use JavaScript to solve in the past (not ideal!), check out [this extremely ancient article](http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/onetruelayout/equalheight) from 2005.

And here's a quick snippet of part of the flexboxless solution for Holy Grail:

```css
main {
  overflow: hidden;
}
main aside, main article {
  padding-bottom: 20010px;  
  margin-bottom: -20000px;  
}
footer {
  position: relative;
}
```

Yikes!!!!!!

## üöÄ Lab 2: Practice practice practice!

In the `flexbox-lab` directory of this repo, you'll find an `index.html` and a `style.css`. Using flexbox properties, get the `index.html` to look like this image, both on mobile widths and desktop widths:

![mockup](./assets/mockup.jpg)

There's a little bit of starter CSS provided.

Here's the lab solutions for each step. **ONLY LOOK AT THESE IF YOU ARE WELL AND TRULY STUCK!!!** And ***DO NOT*** copy and paste!!!! Add each property one at a time and see how the page changes!
