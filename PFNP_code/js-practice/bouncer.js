// Make a function that accepts one argument "age" and return to the user whether they are allowed in the bar.


function bouncer(age){

}

console.log(bouncer(22)) // this should return true
console.log(bouncer(20)) // this should return false



// What if the drinking age was different in different places? Re-do the function so that it can take two arguments. Use yr noggin.
